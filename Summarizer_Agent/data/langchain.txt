LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by language models. It provides components like chains, agents, and memory for creating complex workflows. Chains combine LLMs with prompts and tools, agents enable decision-making and tool usage, and memory supports conversational context. LangChain integrates with vector stores for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling applications like chatbots, research assistants, and more.
