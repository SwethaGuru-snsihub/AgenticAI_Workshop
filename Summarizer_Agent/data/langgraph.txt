LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, multi-agent applications. It uses a graph-based structure to connect nodes representing LLMs, tools, or logic, enabling complex workflows like research systems, decision trees, and multi-step agents. LangGraph supports conditional routing and state management for dynamic query processing. It integrates with LangChain tools and is ideal for applications requiring structured flows and conversational memory.
